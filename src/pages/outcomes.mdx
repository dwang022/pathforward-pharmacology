### First-in-Human Dose Strategy
Integrated PK/PD, efficacy, and safety data with translational models to prioritize FIH dosing. Delivered exposure–response scenarios with transparent assumptions and uncertainty bounds that informed protocol design.

### Biomarker-Driven Development
Identified and validated decision-enabling biomarkers to connect preclinical efficacy with clinical endpoints. Helped align discovery, translational, and clinical teams on measurable criteria for advancement.

### Modality-Specific Pharmacology
Guided pharmacology strategy across small molecules, biologics, ADCs, and immune cell engagers—tailoring study design and read-outs to the mechanism of action and therapeutic class.

### Translational Insight for Oncology Programs
Applied cutting-edge preclinical models to clarify mechanism, de-risk clinical assumptions, and bring clarity to complex oncology pharmacology challenges.
