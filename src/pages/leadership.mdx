    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">Founder & Senior Pharmacologist</p>

      Dr. Wang is a preclinical pharmacologist specializing in oncology therapeuticsâ€”
      from small molecules and biologics to ADCs and immune cell engagers. 
      With over 20 years at Novartis and EMD Serono, she has empowered R&amp;D teams 
      to make confident go/no-go decisions based on data packages spanning PK/PD, 
      efficacy, and biomarker strategy. 

      What sets her apart is her ability to integrate cutting-edge translational 
      models, foster collaboration, and bring clarity to complex pharmacology 
      challenges across discovery and early development.
